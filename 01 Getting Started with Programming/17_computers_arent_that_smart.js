// For extra help, a program called a 'linter' is checking your code

// EDITS MADE:
// Change 10 = 10 to 10 === 10 (with 3 = signs)
// Remove ; after if statement (10 === 10); <--
// Remove ; after ("You got a true"); <--
// Move else clause down to separate line (not necessary but increases readability)
